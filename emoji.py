# CLDR is Common Locale Data Repository, providing data on languages, cultures, regions, and more.
# It includes locale-specific details, language info, country data, currency symbols, and emoji names.
# The heart emoji "‚ù§Ô∏è" is known as "heavy black heart" with the CLDR code ":heavy_black_heart."
# These standardized names and codes ensure consistency and compatibility in applications using emojis.
# Python's `emoji` library facilitates working with emojis using CLDR names and codes in projects.
